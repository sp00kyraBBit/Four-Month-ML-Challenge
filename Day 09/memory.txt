Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.

Machine Learning is mainly divided into three core types: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning along with two additional types, Semi-Supervised and Self-Supervised Learning.

Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.
Note: The following are not part of the original three core types of ML, but they have become increasingly important in real-world applications, especially in deep learning.

Additional Types:

Self-Supervised Learning: Self-supervised learning is often considered as a  subset of unsupervised learning, but it has grown into its own field due to its success in training large-scale models. It generates its own labels from the data, without any manual labeling. 
Semi-Supervised Learning: This approach combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. It’s useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming.

Supervised learning algorithms are generally categorized into two main types: 

Classification - where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories 
Regression - where the aim is to predict continuous numerical values.

Supervised Learning
There are many algorithms used in supervised learning each suited to different types of problems. Some of the most commonly used supervised learning algorithms are:

1. Linear Regression
This is one of the simplest ways to predict numbers using a straight line. It helps find the relationship between input and output.

2. Logistic Regression
Used when the output is a "yes or no" type answer. It helps in predicting categories like pass/fail or spam/not spam.

3. Decision Trees
A model that makes decisions by asking a series of simple questions, like a flowchart. Easy to understand and use.

4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
A bit more advanced—it tries to draw the best line (or boundary) to separate different categories of data.

Understanding SVMs

5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
This model looks at the closest data points (neighbors) to make predictions. Super simple and based on similarity.

Ensemble learning combines multiple simple models to create a stronger, smarter model. There are mainly two types of ensemble learning:

Bagging that combines multiple models trained independently.
Boosting that builds models sequentially each correcting the errors of the previous one.
Module 3: Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning are again divided into three main categories based on their purpose:
